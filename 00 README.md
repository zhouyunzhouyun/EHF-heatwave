# Heatwaves in China
Assessment of Spatiotemporal Variation in Heatwaves and Elderly Population Exposure in China (1964-2022)

TTherefore, the primary objectives of this study are: 
(1) identify the optimal index to evaluate heatwaves in China; 
(2) to calculate the EHF at the grid level from 1964 to 2022 using the GEE platform; 
(3) to synthesize the spatiotemporal variation in heatwaves based on the EHF definition;
(4) to assess the exposure of elderly population faced during heatwaves from 2001 to 2020,
thereby providing practical insights for future research and policy formulation.
