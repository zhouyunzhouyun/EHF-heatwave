The primary objectives of this study are: (1) identify the optimal index to evaluate heatwaves in China; (2) to calculate the EHF at the grid level from 1964 to 2022 using the GEE platform; (3) to synthesize the spatiotemporal variation in heatwaves based on the EHF definition; (4) to assess the exposure of elderly population faced during heatwaves from 2001 to 2020, thereby providing practical insights for future research and policy formulation.
